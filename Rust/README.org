* meltdown-rs

~meltdown-rs~ is a demonstration of [[http://meltdownattack.com/][the Meltdown attack]] in Rust.

** Assumption

+ rustc 1.27.0-nightly (2018-05-10)
+ x86_64
+ no TSX
+ should use exception, instead of ~abort~

** Notes

This implementation is full of unsafe hacks and dark magic... I can't
yet fully understand ~panic!~ and ~catch_unwind~.  Besides that, this
implementation is quite straightforward.
